# Project Overview

This is a colllaborative knowledge base for students to find the best digital tools for their students

## Notion AI

**Notion AI** is an integrated suite of artificial intelligence tools designed to enhance student productivity directly within the Notion workspace. Unlike external AI tools, it has context of your existing notes, allowing it to summarize lectures, brainstorm essay outlines, and even fix grammar without you ever leaving the page.

### Key Features for Students

- **AI Study Assistant:** It can transform messy lecture transcripts into structured study guides, flashcards, or concise summaries in seconds.
- **Writing & Editing:** Students can use the "Improve Writing" or "Change Tone" features to polish assignments and emails to professors.
- **Q&A Search:** You can ask questions like "What are the key dates for my Biology project?" and Notion AI will find the answer from across all your pages.
- **Automated Action Items:** It can automatically extract to-do lists from meeting notes or group project discussions.

### How to Access (Student Discount)

Students can access a free trial of Notion AI on the **Education Plus Plan**. If you have a verified student email, you can sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get even more AI responses and premium features for free.
